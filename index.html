                <h2>What are some factors that affect the cost of a boat rental?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>There are several factors that affect the cost of a boat rental. The type of boat, the length of the rental, and the number of people renting all play a role in how much you’ll pay. <br>

                <br>The length of your rental also affects cost. Most boat rentals are charged by the hour, so if you want to rent for longer than just a few hours, you may be able to get a discount.
